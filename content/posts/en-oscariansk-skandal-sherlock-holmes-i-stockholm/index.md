Two times Holmes mentioned that he had helped the King of Scandinavia, in The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor and A Scandal in Bohemia. In this book we get to know more about what Sherlock and Watson did when helping the king in Stockholm. Holmes is not very happy about the food and weather in a cold Sweden and the mysteries he is requested to solve "Truly a people whose riddles are no sinecure to solve. Sometimes I wonder if we've gotten in over our heads.". Sherlock helps the king that would like to avoid a scandal but he also provides services to the queen.
