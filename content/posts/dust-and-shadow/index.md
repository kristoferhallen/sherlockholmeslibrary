Sherlock Holmes meets Jack the Ripper! Someone is killing women in London, a challenge for the police and soon also for Sherlock Holmes. The killer must be stopped but he is hard to find in the big city and the leads are hard to follow. Faye gives us all the components of a good Sherlock mystery, 19th century London, Mycroft and the police represented by Lestrade.
