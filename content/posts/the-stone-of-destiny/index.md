A new king is to be crowned but there is a problem. Irish separatists have stolen the legendary Coronation stone that every monarch of England has been crowned on since the 14th century. Sherlock and Watson are sent to Ireland in pursuit. Watson narrates and we meet familiar faces including Mycroft who sets the investigation in motion. Ryan captures the adventure spirit of Conan Doyle's novels rather than focusing on locked-room mysteries, the historical elements surrounding Irish independence and the Stone's significance seem to be well-researched. This is a solid pastiche that respects the canon while delivering an action-focused adventure.
