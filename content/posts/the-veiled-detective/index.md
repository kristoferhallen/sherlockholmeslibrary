A book written in the original style of Sherlock Holmes but with a twist, everyone is not exactly as described by Doyle. We get to meet Holmes and Watson, how they meet each other and agree to share rooms at Baker street. But we also learn that Moriarty already is aware of the threat Holmes poses and Moriarty takes action. Read it but be warned that you will see the characters in a new light.
