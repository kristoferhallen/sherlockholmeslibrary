Watson is requested to visit the retired Sherlock, now living in the countryside, and also to bring a mysterious package. Holmes is investigating a murder on the Calais coach, a murder that has already been investigated by a capable detective, Hercule Poirot. Holmes is not sure that Poirot has come to the right conclusion. "[the worlds] Second greatest detective" as Holmes calls Poirot, of course putting himself first. It is of course Agatha Christie's mystery in Murder on the Orient Express that Holmes is working on (The american title was Murder in the Calais Coach). Well written, get's a high rating since it includes two of the great detectives.
