The seven percent solution is one of the most famous pastiches, and it's an essential read for any fan of the iconic detective. 

In this novel, Sherlock Holmes is grappling with a crippling drug addiction. Desperate to help, Dr. Watson convinces Holmes to seek treatment from none other than Sigmund Freud in Vienna. Holmes and Freud get along well and Freud manages to treat the drug addiction and what really creates a bond is that they both become involved in a case. I don't want to spoil anything can just say that you will get a new view on Moriarty after reading this book.
