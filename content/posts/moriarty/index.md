Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty are dead after the fall at the Reichenbach Falls. A new criminal mastermind seem to be establishing in London and Inspector Jones and Pinkerton agent Frederick Chase join forces to stop this new threat. A good story, very much in the style of the original books, now from a new perspective.
