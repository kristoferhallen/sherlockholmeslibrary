During the First World War, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson come out of retirement to assist Mycroft in solving a series of unexplained deaths. As usual, Mycroft may not have disclosed everything he knows, leaving Sherlock to determine who can be trusted in a world at war. Central to the mystery is the enigmatic Spirit Box. Clues lead them to a man whose photographs are rumored to capture men’s souls. Intriguing, but not my top pick.
