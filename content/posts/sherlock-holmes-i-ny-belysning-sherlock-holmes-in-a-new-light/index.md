Do you want to know the real Sherlock Holmes, behind the perfect detective described in the stories written by Dr Watson? You need to be able to read Swedish, then you can get hold of this book written by Sture Stig, or as his real name was, [Frans Oskar Wågman](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_W%C3%A5gman), a Swedish vicar that also was an avid writer. In the stories a Swedish priest gets to know Dr Watson and gets to learn the real story behind the adventures of Sherlock Holmes. How frustrating it is for Watson to live with Sherlock and that many of the cases are failures. Can be a bit frustrating to read for a Sherlock Holmes lover, you don't want to see your hero described as a failure, but these are good stories written by someone that loved and knew the original stories.
