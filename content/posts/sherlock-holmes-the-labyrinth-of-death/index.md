Holmes and Watson search for a missing woman and find that she in turn is looking for a missing person that has joined a sect obsesses with Ancient Greek myths. A traditional pastiche, entertaining and when you get to the labyrinth part that the title mentions you want to know how it ends. However, it takes some time until you get there and there are not that many passages that gives Sherlock a chance to shine and do deductions. Watson says that he in this story tries to show more of himself and he definitely does, if he helps or maybe makes situations worse by acting before thinking could be discussed.
