An old Sherlock contemplates his life. He is now living on the English countryside and is starting to see his body and mind being affected by age. He tries to remember the details of his last case, he reflects on a recent trip to meet a fellow beekeeper in Japand and we also get to know about the relation between him, his housekeeper Mrs. Munro and her son Roger.

I never really got to into this book, I'm probably looking for mysteries and crimes being solved. This, although set in the Sherlock Holmes universe, is more a book about psycology, aging and relationships.
