Mycroft sends Sherlock and Watson to investigate a circus. One of the strange circus performers is murdered and Sherlock's enquires leads to a man with a mysterious background and a portrait in a secret room, Dorian Gray. Is Gray an enemy or an ally? Who are the circus performers, are they even human? A great story with many of the elements from original novels but add a Dorian Gray with an extraordinary strength and agility and adversaries that are more monsters than men.
