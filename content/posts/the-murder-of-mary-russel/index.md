Laurie R King has written a series about Mary Russel and her adventures together with Sherlock Holmes. She first appears in the novel The Beekeeper's Apprentice. The murder of Mary Russel is the fourteenth novel in the series. Sherlock comes home and instead of meeting Mary he finds a scene with blood on the floor an gunpowder in the air. Driven by fear and determination, he embarks on a relentless quest to uncover the truth: Is his wife dead or alive? A now grown upp Wiggins soon joins the chase and you also get to know more about Mrs Hudson's history. 

The Mary Russel series is well written, a lot of good mysteries across the world and you get some of the traditional Sherlock Holmes deductions but here you also have Mary as very different Sherlock companion compared to Watson. Mary many times is as good or even better than Sherlock in some areas.
