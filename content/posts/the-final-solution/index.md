The second world war is ongoing, Sherlock is old and lives in a cottage on the English countryside, taking care of his bees. A mute jewish boy and his parrot who has escaped from Germany crosses his path. the parrot talks, sometimes long number series and this draws attention. Could it be secret codes important for the Germans? A murder connected to the boy and his parrot gets Sherlock back into the action, although a bit slower and with less physical activity. 
This is a great book, the mystery is ok but for me it's mostly the atmosphere and the setting. A slower pace, the country side, a child and an old man and their attempts at communication. There is no Watson that tells the story, you get to see the story from multiple peoples perspective. Some mysteries in the book are resolved, some are never explained.
