The Game is the seventh book in the Mary Russell [series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Russell_(character)) ([reviews](https://sherlock.kristoferhallen.com/tags/mary-russel/)) about Mary Russel and Sherlock Holmes. 

The detective duo embarks on a dangerous mission to colonial India. Summoned by Mycroft Holmes, they set out to locate his missing agent—none other than Kimball O'Hara, the same "Kim" from Rudyard Kipling's famous novel. This books is set in the context of colonial India and [The Great game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Game), the rivalry between the 19th-century British and Russian empires over influence in Central Asia. Russel and Holmes find new friends but also realize that not all people can be trusted, the enemy is also on the track.
