There are two original stories where Arsène Lupin meets Sherlock Holmes, or Herlock Sholmes as the opponent was originally called. There are now editions that use the name Sherlock Holmes. I have the book featuring the story The Blonde Lady, where Holmes is called upon to assist the French police in capturing the gentleman thief Arséne Lupin. I appreciate that Leblanc resisted the temptation to make his hero, Lupin, the smarter of the two. Instead, it becomes a struggle between two brilliant minds, each managing to secure their own victories. Maybe not the best pastishe but I have to give it a high rating just based on the exitement of reading a storye where to characters from different fictional universes meet. I get the same feeling reading "Ett osannolikt möte" when [Van Veeteren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Veeteren) and [Kurt Wallander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Wallander) meet.
