In London, 1890, Christmas is approaching. A man attempts to abduct a child on the street, only to be thwarted by Holmes and Watson, who happen upon the scene. Now, they must determine if the child remains in danger and hunt down the mysterious assailant. While the story is skillfully written in the style of the original books, the plot for me lacks the depth to fully engage.
