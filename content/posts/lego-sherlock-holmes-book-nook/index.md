This summer Lego released the [Sherlock Holmes book nook](https://www.lego.com/en-se/product/sherlock-holmes-book-nook-10351) featuring Baker street 221B and five minifigures, Sherlock Holmes. Watson, Higgins, Irene Adler and Moriarty. When closed it's great for the bookshelf but you can also open it and explore several doors and secret areas, e.g. a mysterious person in a window across Baker street 221B and a wall that opens up to show Sherlock's sitting room.
