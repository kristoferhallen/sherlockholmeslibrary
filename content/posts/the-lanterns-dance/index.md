The Game is the eighteenth book in the Mary Russell [series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Russell_(character)) ([reviews](https://sherlock.kristoferhallen.com/tags/mary-russel/)) about Mary Russel and Sherlock Holmes. 

Mary and Sherlock travel to France to visit Sherlock's son but when they arrive the son and his family have disappeared. Sherlock sets out to find his son and Mary, with a sprained ankle, stays in the house and starts to decode a book written in code that might give clues to what has happened. As most books in the series this is well written and this book has some new elements. One is that there are two time lines, the search for the son and the story in the mysterious book. Another is that this book of course have deductions, disguises and suspense but it is more of a background to a story about Sherlock's family.
