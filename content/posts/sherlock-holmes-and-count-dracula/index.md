A Transylvanian nobleman called Count Dracula arrives at Baker Street seeking the help of Sherlock Holmes. And yes, Dracula is a vampire. This is a start of an adventure where Sherlock and Watson need to form an alliance with vampires to fight a greater threat and expect some surprising twists. This is a well written book that works well as a novel combining classic Sherlock deductions and action.
