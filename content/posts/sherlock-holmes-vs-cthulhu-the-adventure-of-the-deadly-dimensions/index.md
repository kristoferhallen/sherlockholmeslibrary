Sherlock and Watson investigate a series of murders in London. The more they learn the harder it becomes to uncover a locical solution to the mystery. A cult, a machine that seems to grow without human intervention, ancient mysterious books, creatures that seem to appear out of thin air. Even Moriarty fears the unexplained phenomena. Sherlock remains steadfast in his belief in science and logic, though his resolve is tested. 

It's intriguing to watch Sherlock grapple with a mystery that defies his rigid rationality. However, the book's length detracts from its pacing, and I found myself not fully immersed in the story.
