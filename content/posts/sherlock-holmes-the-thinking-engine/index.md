Sherlock Holmes has been challenged! An Oxford professor has built a groundbreaking computational device — a "thinking engine" — which he claims surpasses even Sherlock Holmes himself in reasoning and deduction. Sherlock and Watson accept the challenge and travel to Oxford. The machine solves a recent murder in the city but Holmes is not fully convinced of the capabilities of the machine. He stays in Oxford and more crimes are committed, are they connected with each other, and with the machine? This novel was written before ChatGPT and other AI tools but in some sense bring up the same type of questions that we try to answer now, what if machines can do much more than we thought, what does that mean for humans? A captivating read with action and an unexpected twist at the end. 

I like when authors let Holmes meet other well known people, in this book he meets Harry Houdini, some time before he becomes a famous escapologist but who is already making use of those talents.
