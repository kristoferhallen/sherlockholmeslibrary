A graphic novel in two volumes. Makes me think of the BBC Sherlock tv-series when you get to see Sherlock thinking, places, people, things, moving around, connections being created. Here we literally follow a red thread across the pages. A terrific comic with great art. A good case that every Sherlock Holmes fan will appreciate.
