Sherlock Holmes and Watson are called to Stockholm to assist the colleague Ture Sventon, a famous swedish detective. They travel to Stockholm using Sventon's flying carpet. When in Sventon's office on Drottninggatan the two detectives realize that they both think that the other had asked for help, is it a trap? The game is afoot! If you haven't met Ture Sventon make sure to also read the books about him, the detective that needs a constant supply of [semlor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semla), is not able to pronounce "s" in many situations (for instance, he says "temla" instead of "semla"), and usually travels on a flying carpet.
