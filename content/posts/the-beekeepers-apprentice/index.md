Laurie R King has written a series about Mary Russel and her adventures together with Sherlock Holmes. The Beekeeper's Apprentice is the first book where we meet Mary Russel, she is only fifteen, has lost her parents and is studying chemistry and theology. During the summer break she meets a beekeeper, Sherlock Holmes. They become friends and Holmes teaches her everything a detective needs to know. These skills prove valuable when they together are pulled into more and more dangerous adventures. 

This is probably the first Sherlock pastiche that I read and it helped me see that there are more people that love Sherlock Holmes and that the stories are still being written.
