In a collection of short detective stories that takes place in Stockholm we find A Scandal in Stockholm, the story behind the remark about the King of Scandinavia that Holmes mentions in A Scandal in Bohemia. The King of Sweden and Norway asks Sherlock for help, the kins connection to a certain actress can't be made public so that a great scandal can be avoided. The game is afoot and Sherlock and Watson travel to Stockholm. A classic Sherlock story with decuctions, disguises and a succesful solution to the case. As a Swede it is amusing to see their reactions to the weather and food in Stockholm around 1900.
