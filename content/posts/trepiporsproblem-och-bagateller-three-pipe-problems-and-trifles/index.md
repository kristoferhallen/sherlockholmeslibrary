This is a book about some scientific details of the world of Sherlock Holmes written by a theoretical physicist. You won't find any classical cases here but you will get detailed reasoning about things like tattoos and Chinese coins (The read-headed League). What kid of square, pierced Chinese coin is he referring to? Is Sherlock´s calculation of the train speed in Silver Blaze reasonable? And the do the calculations of parsley sinking in butter (The adventure of the six Napoleons) match a physicists calculations? 

Unfortunately you can only find the book in Swedish. [Hans-Uno](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Uno_Bengtsson) was a theoretical physicist with a great talent for communicating science. The books is not easy to read, you need to get ready for math and physics, but it is hard not to be drawn into Hans-Unos love for the Sherlock Holmes and the enthusiasm with which he tries to explain things that Sherlock and Watson mentions only as a side note.
