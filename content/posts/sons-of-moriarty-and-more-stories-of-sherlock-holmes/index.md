A collection of Sherlock Holmes novels from several writers including Adrian Conan Doyle. Some well written pastisches. A Schlock Homes of 221B Bagel street story is also included, more focus on the theme than the mystery and a lot of puns and a science fiction story where detectives start to be replaced by machines called “Sherlocks”. This is such a fun combination of many styles that I give it a high rating.
