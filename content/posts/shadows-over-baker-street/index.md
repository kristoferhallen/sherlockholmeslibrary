A collection of short stories where Holmes faces mysteries that lay beyond the grasp of logic. Holmes and Watson encounter  Lovecraftian monsters instead of the human criminals in London. A study in Emerald by Neil Gaiman is great, you get a lot of references to the original stories, the London streets are what you expect them to be in a Sherlock Holmes story. But there is another layer added from the Lovecraftian universe and as you read there are more and more twists, this is a very different London and people are not what you assumed them to be.
