A comics pastiche where Sherlock meets Arsene Lupin. I don't know if there is an English version, I have read it in Swedish. It is a good comic but as a Sherlock Holmes fan I don't like it. It is told from the perspective of Lupin and Holmes is from the start described as quite ruthless. I have not read the second part, maybe I would like that part better but the part 2 thing is another thing I don't like. I want the full story in one book.
