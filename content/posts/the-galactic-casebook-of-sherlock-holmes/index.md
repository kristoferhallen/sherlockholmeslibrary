John D Watson, MD of the Empirical Medical Department, is injured in the attack on the New Highgate space station and dismissed from the Empirical army. He is then introduced to the criminal consultant Sherlock Holmes that has a spare room at his apartment in Baker Street Tower, Sector 221 B, on Starship UK. In eight short stories, based on original stories such as A study in scarlet and The Red-Headed League, but now in a Sci-fi context, Sherlock and Watson solve cases and Sherlock can see the pattern of a criminal mastermind in the shadows. Not on the top of my list but of course you need to read about Sherlock Holmes in space.
