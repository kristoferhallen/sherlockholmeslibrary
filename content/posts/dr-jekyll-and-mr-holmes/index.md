![Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Holmes](/drjekyllandmrholmes.jpg#floatleft) A close friend of the renowned London doctor Henry Jekyll grows concerned over Jekyll’s increasingly strange behavior and turns to Sherlock Holmes for help. Dr. Jekyll appears to have a secretive and unsettling connection to a loathsome figure named Edward Hyde. When Hyde is spotted committing the murder of a member of Parliament and subsequently vanishes, even the government seeks Holmes' expertise to track him down. According to Dr. Watson, this account reveals the untold story behind Robert Louis Stevenson’s famous novel, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
