Garment of Shadows follows Mary Russell, who awakens with amnesia, bloodstained hands, and no memory of her identity or how she got there. She starts the search for who she is and meanwhile her husband Sherlock Holmes searches frantically for her. 

This book is part of King's [book series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Russell_(character)) ([reviews](https://sherlock.kristoferhallen.com/tags/mary-russel/)) about Mary Russel and Sherlock Holmes, each book usually with a specific theme and country and this time it is Morocco in the 1920s. King blends historical fiction with mystery, vividly portraying Morocco's culture and the political complexities of colonial North Africa while delivering another adventure in the Russell-Holmes partnership.
